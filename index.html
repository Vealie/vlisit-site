    <h2>What is The V List?</h2>
    <p>
      The V List is a simple, WhatsApp-based shopping list designed for couples, families, and housemates. 
      By messaging your dedicated V List number on WhatsApp, you can add, remove, or view items from a shared list — no apps to download, no accounts to manage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you're coordinating a weekly shop or managing a busy household, The V List keeps everyone on the same page with a private, fast, and familiar chat-based experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our service runs entirely on the WhatsApp Business Platform and is built with privacy, simplicity, and shared convenience in mind.
